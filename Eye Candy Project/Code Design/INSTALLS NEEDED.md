pip install matplotlib
pip install extcolors
pip install colormap
pip install opencv-python
pip install easydev

## Do you want this REPO? | Downloads NEEDED
Once pulling the repo from github, open your terminal

You will 
        1. cd into eye-candy
        2. npm install 
        3. npm install axios -save dev
        4. npm install concurrently --save-dev

Just Incase there are missing modules, pay attention to terminal for whatever is missing when you do 'npm run start:both'
Some potential missing modules:
        1. npm install cookie-parser
        2. npm install bcrypt 
        3. npm install cors
        4. npm install nodemon
        5. npm install axios 

Those stated above are unlikely to occur but, some users come across that issue

## To run the program, type in the terminal
npm run start:both

These should be the only steps required to pull the repo and make it work at this moment.
