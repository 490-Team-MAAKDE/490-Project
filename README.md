# Project: Eye Candy



## Introduction
Our goal with this application is to provide users with stylish recommendations for outfits using machine learning and color theory. 
This application will be able to aid uninformed users in fashion by creating and providing them with several recommendations of new styles of clothing/outfis without having to manually create one.
